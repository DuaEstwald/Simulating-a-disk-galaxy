# Simulating-a-disk-galaxy

In this repository we can find the code use for the thrid project of Tecnicas de Simulation Numerica.

路 Part1.py: Code use for the first part of the work

路 Part2.py: Code use for the second part.

路 Part3.py: Code use for the thrid part. Implementation of the interaction between all the particles.

路 EXTRApart.py: Code use for the extra part. Implementation of the kdtree algorithm.


Note that the Part2, Part3 and EXTRApart takes outputs for set the numbers of particles, the softening lenght and the number of neighbours. 


The rest of files are the files used for make the plots that we can find in the pdf project.
